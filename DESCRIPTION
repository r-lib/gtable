Description: Tools to make it easier to work with "tables" of
    'grobs'. The 'gtable' package defines a 'gtable' grob class that specifies a
    grid along with a list of grobs and their placement in the grid. Further the
    package makes it easy to manipulate and combine 'gtable' objects so that 
    complex compositions can be built up sequentially.
